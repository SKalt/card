        My life changed more this year than most past years. In March I sudenly
        had to give up climbing and thus any semblance of a social life. In June
        I moved out of MA, following my partner Emma to her residency at Johns
        Hopkins. We landed on our feet: I was fortunate enough to keep my job,
        we secured a spacious apartment, and we adopted two cats,

        Despite shifts in my lifestyle, quarantine made my days seem nearly
        uneventful. I'm including an electronic recipe book as a representative
        sample of some of my consistent passtimes: cooking and coding.

        I strongly dislike backstories in recipe blogs, but if you'd like, you
        can read why I included these recepes alonside the links below.

            I got good at making these early in the pandemic. Eating a
            greasy-spoon breakfast for dinner makes staying at home more
            enjoyable.

          <p>
            Emma and I started out with grand dreams of an apartment filled with
            houseplants. Bored cats and inexperienced gardeners largely squashed
            that idea. Our greatest success yet has been our basil bush, which
            takes up nearly all of the window over our sink.

            Yogurt bread
          </summary>
          <p>
            This is Grandma Kalt's yogurt bread. My Dad passed down the
            tradition of baking it. I don't know who, but someone passed down
            another tradition: being lazy and automating everything possible.
            This recipe can take as little as 10 minutes of prep time with flour
            premeasured into a jar, dry yeast, and a bread machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried making sourdough in the first few months of the pandemic. I
            gave up any hope of making artisanal bread after cleaning out a few
            jars of failed starter.

          <p>
            Goes great with the aforementioned bread. This is another recipe
            that I pre-measure into a jar for rapid assembly.
            <!-- I don't know if this recipe is ready to rival Cambell's split pea soup -- it doesn't have quite the same taste of tin -- but after a day in the refrigerator retains the shape of t  -->

          <p>
            This is the first soup where I thought I could taste the difference
            of adding a bay leaf. I may have been wrong, but I've made the
            recipe enough for it to merit a place here.
